1. The playing field is a square-shaped board,
    divided into 9 equal fields by 4 intersecting lines:
    2 vertically and 2 horizontally, each of which is divided by two
    perpendicular to it lines into three equal parts.

2. The players place tic-tac-toe alternately on each field.

3. When one of the players creates a line of three crosses or three circles,
    crosses it out and becomes the winner. When all fields are full and no
    a line is formed and the game is tied.
